# Rails 4 Template

This Rails 4 template was written to make the process of starting a very basic Rails app easier, and make my personal Rails app bootstrap instruction guide obsolete.

The Rails 3 version of this template is [here](https://github.com/paulfioravanti/rails_template).

The template reflects my Rails preferences in the following ways:

- Always internationalize
- Postgresql for database
- Hide away all secret data in [Figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro) configuration
- [Bootstrap](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass) and [Haml](https://github.com/haml/haml)-ize views
- Test with [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails)
- Use as many relevant code quality tools as possible during development

## Usage

    $ rails new my_app -m https://raw.github.com/paulfioravanti/rails_4_template/master/template.rb

## Dependencies

This template was created to run using [RVM](https://rvm.io/) with:

- Ruby 2.0.0
- Rails 4.0.0
